Rust implementation of [Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com/).

As per the Go original, we have a [tree-walking interpreter version](./src/evaluator.rs), and a
[stack-based VM version](./src/vm/mod.rs).

The interpreter is around 4 times slower than the VM version.

    fib 18 (VM)             time:   [8.3043 ms 8.3459 ms 8.3911 ms]

And the Rust VM is [4 times slower than the Go VM](../../go/src/README.md).

    > time ./target/release/vm-flamegraph
    Result: 9227465

    user	0m25.634s
    sys	0m0.043s

I would put this down to various things:

* this is my first Rust program of any size. 5k lines of Rust â€“ I'm still learning :)
* this is a direct port of the Go version to Rust. Some Go idioms will not translate well. For
  example, the Go version does not need to copy Object implementations. `vm.push` will push the
  pointer. In Rust, ownership rules mean that with the current design, we need to clone constant
  Objects when pushing them on to the stack. An performance improvement in the Rust
  implementation might mean that `vm.pop()` will return an owned Object, rather than a borrowed
  one?

It's been a really interesting exercise. I've not yet found many other Rust-based stack VMs to compare approaches and learn from.

## Profiling

### Flamegraphs

    cargo install flamegraph
    cargo flamegraph --root --bin vm-flamegraph

This will generate a flamegraph based on the recursive fibonacci program for the 35th fibonacci number. Useful to see where time is going, and was the thing that guided improvements which gave a 4-fold improvement in execution time.

### Instruments (on MacOS)

Instruments is the profiling toolset in Xcode.

    cargo install cargo-instruments
    cargo instruments --bin vm-flamegraph --open

This takes longer to capture the data, but gave another very fine-grained view of CPU time for `fib(35)`.

### CLion with Rust plugin

Running the profiler in CLion gave a much more detailed flamegraph.
See [flamegraphs](flamegraphs/) for the exports.

We can use the exported trace to re-create a flamegraph in other tooling such as [inferno](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno).

    cargo install inferno
    cat flamegraphs/af1dadfcda_vm-flamegraph_2021-05-03-012730.collapsed | inferno-flamegraph > flamegraph.svg

This showed that time was being spent in:

* ~15% in `VM::call_function`
* ~15% in `VM::get_global`

Both of those were spending lots of time in `object::Object::clone`, which were respectively spending time in `Vec::clone`.
So that's a lot of memory copying happening.
